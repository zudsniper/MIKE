`MIKE` is a further yet level of abstraction above even `Auto-GPT` which aims to accomplish several things. 
1. Images, along with any other in-use assets such as settings, redis images, etc, must be pausable, saveable, **and copyable.**  
2. Plugins should be installed via a **built-in package management system** as much as possible.
